mother_table,Cohort timing,"Most specific complications (the other cohorts) typically manifest during various stages of pregnancy, labour, or the postpartum period, thus occurring subsequent to the initial entry into the mother_table cohort (defined as the start of pregnancy), while pre-existing conditions like obesity or conditions diagnosed very early such as ectopic pregnancy may occur concurrently or very shortly after.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.5-flash

stillbirth,Clinical description,"Stillbirth is the death of a foetus at or after 24 completed weeks of gestation, before or during birth. Its aetiology is often multifactorial, including placental dysfunction, maternal medical conditions, infections, foetal abnormalities, and umbilical cord complications.",cohort_count,gemini-2.5-flash
stillbirth,Frequency,"Stillbirth is a relatively rare but significant obstetric complication, occurring in approximately 1 in 200 births globally, with lower rates in high-income countries. Cases can be identified in various real-world healthcare data sources, including hospital discharge records, birth registers, and obstetric-specific electronic health records.",cohort_count,gemini-2.5-flash
stillbirth,Median age of incident cases,"30 to 34 (The risk of stillbirth increases with advancing maternal age, thus the median age for mothers experiencing a stillbirth is typically slightly higher than the median age for all pregnant individuals.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.5-flash
stillbirth,Percentage male,"53% to 56% (Foetal sex ratio among stillbirths is skewed towards males, as male foetuses are known to have a slightly higher biological vulnerability and increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.5-flash
stillbirth,Survival at five years,"98% to 99% (Maternal survival after a stillbirth is very high, as the death is foetal; however, severe maternal complications that contributed to the stillbirth can rarely lead to subsequent maternal mortality.)",cohort_survival,gemini-2.5-flash
stillbirth,Cohort overlap,"Substantial overlap (10-40%) is expected with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, antepartum haemorrhage, obesity, and preterm labour. Moderate overlap (5-15%) can be seen with eclampsia, HELLP, dysfunctional labour, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Lesser overlap (1-5%) may occur with deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, and pregnant alcohol misuse. Minimal overlap (less than 1%) is expected with maternal death, postpartum endometritis, anaphylaxis pregnant, Bells palsy pregnant, encephalitis pregnant, Guillain barre syndrome pregnant, myocardial infarction pregnant, myocarditis or pericarditis pregnant, transverse myelitis pregnant, narcolepsy pregnant, and thrombosis thrombocytopenia syndrome pregnant. There is no overlap (0%) with ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage due to definitional differences. All stillbirth cases would be part of the mother table (100%).",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.5-flash
stillbirth,Cohort timing,"Maternal conditions like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and obesity typically manifest weeks or months prior to a stillbirth diagnosis, while acute complications such as antepartum haemorrhage or eclampsia can precede it by hours to days, and postpartum haemorrhage would occur following the delivery of the stillborn infant.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.5-flash
stillbirth,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Preeclampsia, Gestational diabetes, Obesity, Chronic hypertension, Antiphospholipid syndrome, Thyroid disorders, Renal disease, Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, Thrombophilia, Systemic lupus erythematosus (These conditions either directly impair placental function, compromise foetal development, or negatively impact overall maternal health, thereby significantly increasing the risk of stillbirth.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.5-flash
stillbirth,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Reduced foetal movements, Vaginal bleeding, Abdominal pain, Uterine contractions, Hypertension, Proteinuria, Headache, Visual disturbances, Fever, Oedema (These signs and symptoms represent indications of potential foetal distress, placental compromise, severe maternal complications such as preeclampsia, or maternal infection, all of which can precede or be associated with stillbirth.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.5-flash
stillbirth,Frequently seen medications,"Low-dose aspirin, Insulin, Labetalol, Nifedipine, Enoxaparin, Thyroxine, Antibiotics, Iron supplements, Folic acid, Oxytocin (These medications are typically prescribed to manage pre-existing maternal conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or thrombophilias that increase the risk of stillbirth, or for the acute management of pregnancy complications and labour induction in the event of stillbirth.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.5-flash
