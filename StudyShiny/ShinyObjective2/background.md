#### Safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines administered during pregnancy: a target trial emulation and meta-analysis of 4 European countries.

##### Background
Pregnant individuals were excluded from early COVID-19 vaccine trials, resulting in limited initial evidence on vaccine safety during pregnancy. Subsequent observational studies suggest that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, many studies were underpowered to assess rare events and the safety of different vaccine doses.

##### Objectives
To evaluate the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered during pregnancy by assessing the risk of adverse maternal and pregnancy outcomes associated with:

1) First COVID-19 vaccine dose during pregnancy, compared with unvaccinated pregnancies;

2) Second COVID-19 vaccine dose during pregnancy, compared with pregnancies eligible for a second dose but not yet vaccinated;

3) Booster (third or subsequent) COVID-19 vaccine dose during pregnancy, compared with pregnancies eligible for a booster dose but not yet vaccinated.

##### Methods
We conducted cohort studies emulating target trials using four real-world data sources: UK primary care data, primary care data linked to hospital records from Catalonia (Spain), and nationwide linked health registries from Norway and Sweden, all mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model. Pregnant women aged 12–55 years with at least 365 days of prior observation were eligible.

For each vaccine dose (first, second, booster), vaccinated pregnancies were compared with pregnancies eligible for the same dose but not yet vaccinated, matched on gestational age and maternal age. Outcomes included 15 adverse events of special interest and 13 maternal adverse events, assessed over outcome-specific risk windows.

Propensity score overlap weighting was applied for covariate balance (unbalance indicated by standardised mean difference ≤0.1). Residual confounding was evaluated using 38 negative control outcomes, and empirical calibration was applied where indicated. Incidence rate ratios were estimated within each database and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

##### Conclusions
This large, multinational target trial emulation and meta-analysis will provide robust evidence on the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines across different doses during pregnancy, including rare maternal and pregnancy outcomes.
