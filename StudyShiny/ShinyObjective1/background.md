## Background Rates of Adverse Events during Pregnancy
### Research Question: 
Which are the background incidence rates of selected adverse events during pregnancy? Which are the differences in baseline characteristics between women who experience an adverse event during pregnancy vs. those pregnancies without the adverse event?

### Research Objectives:
The main objective is to estimate and characterise background incidence rates of adverse events on pregnant women. Specific objectives are:

– To estimate incidence rates and cumulative incidence of selected adverse events in pregnant women.

– To describe demographic and clinical characteristics of pregnant women with incident outcomes and compare their characteristics with individuals of similar age and gestational age but without the outcome.
